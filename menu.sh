#Group project 16 applied programming

#This interface allows the user to perform mathmatical operations

#Task 1:   Find the even multiples of any number â€“ the user should specify the multiples of which
#          number they want to print and how many of them.

#Task 2:   Find the terms of any linear sequence given by the rule Un = an + b, where a and b are
#          integers specified by the user and n is a positive integer, and print them in increasing order
#          The user also will specify how many terms the program should print. The user should be
#          allowed to choose another sequence and for the number of terms chosen the program should
#          calculate and print their sum.


#Task 3:   Find the numbers that can be expressed as the product of two nonnegative integers in
#          succession and print  them in increasing order.
#          The user should specify a maximum value and the program should print all said numbers smaller than or equal to
#          that value. The program should keep a count of how many numbers were printed and should
#          output that count, as well as the numbers.
#          Your application should be user friendly. 



#This is the menu where you can choose which task you would like to execute
